# Power-Bi
 Glad to share my work on a Data set "Income Evaluation". As the data set containing demographic information such as "Age", "Work class", "Sex" and a native country.
ðŸ‘‰ This project aims to explore the relationships between these factors and income levels.
ðŸ‘‰ the problem statement provides a clear direction for the analysis of income levels based on Demographic factors.
ðŸ‘‰ using POWERBI as Data Visualization tool for creating a Dash Board and performed DAX to showcase report findings.
